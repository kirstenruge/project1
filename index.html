<p id="objective">I come from a unique background of science, applied mathematics, music and customer service, and bring a large knowledgebase and warm enthusiasm to any setting. I thrive in work environments that provide challenging projects, clear expectations and minimal supervision. Also, I have a history of learning new software, interfaces and languages extremely quickly and have always been designated the "tech girl" at every job I've held. I intend to learn to code in Java and C++ and then add the necessary skills or languages to develop mobile applications. By adding the ability to code to my skillset, I believe I will be able to pursue jobs in a variety of sectors, including agribusiness, biological reaearch, GPS services and music education. I am most intrugued by the intimacy shared between a user and their mobile device, and the potential to create truly unique programs that enhance daily life.
